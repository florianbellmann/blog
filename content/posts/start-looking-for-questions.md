Answers. We often look for answers. The reason we are here, why we are not happy, why everything is so hard or how to become rich.

I learned that it's a lot more effective to actually look for the right questions. 
Questions like: 

- When do I feel starved for time?
- Am I hunting for important goals or just things I consider important but aren't?
- Why am I feeling I need to do this?
- What of this does not make sense?
- How can I waste money on this problem?
- Is this really the best way to do things?
- When I'm old, how much would I be willing to pay to travel back in time and relive the moment that I'm experiencing right now?

It appears asking yourself these questions and writing down the answers to them is a very productive process. It forces you to really THINK about it. 

The answers will follow naturally :)
