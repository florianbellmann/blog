During the last year, my life changed a lot and the quality of my life increased tremendously. I found myself thinking and pondering that I live the perfect life. I realized I already live in the state I always wished to archive. This feeling of appreaciation and thankfulness can lead to great happiness and fulfillment.

But, next I felt fear. The fear of losing what I have, because I felt I might not deserve what I was living. Maybe a bad illness might happen, someone might die, ... 

This feeling stayed for a while.

## What if I were a billionaire?

Then one day meditating I asked myself: What would I be thinking if I were a billionaire? Would I have the same feelings? Or even more intense ones? But billionaires also live long lives. There are no rules for this. Who says that nature is fair? Fairness is a concept of humans. None of my fears are remotely rational. 

Fears like this are generally not rational. From the outside they look weird and foolish. But they sure feel real. Even more important to meditate and journal and reach clarity in your mind. 

Now only thankfulness and appreaciation are left :)
