Yes, do not believe everything that is going on in your head. Do not fall for the illusion that you actually understand everything. Anything really. 

It is just your perspective, your point of view, your intellectual horizon. 

Maybe you see some person and think: "How stupid of that person. I would do it differently."
But why? Because of your understanding of things? Because you know how it all works?

If you think you know better, think again.
