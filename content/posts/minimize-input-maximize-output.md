We constantly consume. Social media, netflix, spotify, podcasts, sports tv, YouTube, ... The list is pretty long. 

Yes, recreational time is important. Pretty important. The enjoyment I get of a well-shot netflix series is of great worth. 

Nevertheless I find it at least the same relaxing to consume less. If we downplay the amount of comsumption we practice when it comes to attention, we get nice benefits from it. First you might get bored and then you start getting things done. When you minimize the input you get, you automatically have more time to get things done. Which itself calms your mind.

I am not suggestion to focus fully on productiveness. More so, I think mindfulness practice or simply doing nothing from time to time is what our brains need. This way we dont stack more and more onto the pile of things buzzing around in our heads. It will generate a feeling of well-being and being organized, which also improves your state of mind.

Living this way you can actually handpick the things you really WANT to comsume and enjoy them more conciously.
