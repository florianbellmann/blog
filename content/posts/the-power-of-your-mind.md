The more I meditate the more I become fascinated and aware of the connection between mind and body. Again and again I realize situations where I get stressed or provoked and see how my body reacts to it. 
Sweating, heat or even tense muscles in my back. This technique is very useful and more and more times I manage to step back and realize this. When you take a step back you can see the sensations and thoughts for what they are and where they come from. 

This way, YOU can choose how you react to everything. You are in full control and nothing can change that. 

Amazing :)
